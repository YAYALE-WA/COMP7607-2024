Here are some observations:\n\n1. The `encode_shift` function correctly shifts every character in the input string by 5 positions in the alphabet. It uses the ASCII values of the characters to perform the shift and handles non-alphabetic characters by skipping them.\n\n2. The `decode_shift` function takes an additional `shift` parameter, which allows it to shift the characters by any value. This is useful for decoding strings that were encoded with a different shift value.\n\n3. The `decode_shift` function without the `shift` parameter is implemented by calling the `decode_shift` function with a shift value of -5. This is a good way to provide a default behavior for the function.\n\n4. The code includes test cases to verify the correctness of the functions. The test cases cover both the `encode_shift` and `decode_shift` functions with different shift values.\n\n5. The code uses type hints to indicate the expected types of the function parameters and return values. This makes the code more readable and self-documenting.\n\n6. The code uses a consistent naming convention and follows PEP 8 style guidelines.\n\n7.

However, I can be improved for better performance and readability. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1.  **Early Return:** Instead of checking if the `coordinates` list is empty at the end and returning an empty list, you can return an empty list immediately if the `coordinates` list is empty after the loops. This can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary sorting.\n\n2.  **Type Hints:** Adding type hints for the function parameters and return type can improve code readability and help catch type-related errors.\n\n3.  **Docstring:** While your docstring is good, it would be more helpful to include a description of the function's purpose and a list of parameters with their types and descriptions.\n\n4.  **Variable Names:** While your variable names are clear, it would be more consistent to use a single space between words instead of underscores.\n\nHere's the updated code with these suggestions:\n\n```python\ndef get_row(lst: list[list[int]], x: int) -> list[tuple[int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the coordinates of the target value in a 2D list.\n\n    Args:\n    lst: A 2D list of integers.\n    x: The target value to find.\n\n    Returns:\n    A list of tuples, where each tuple contains the row and column indices of the target value.\n    The list is sorted by row in ascending order and then by column in descending order.\n    \"\"\"\n    coordinates = []\n    for i, row in enumerate(lst):\n        for j, elem in enumerate(row):\n            if elem == x:\n                coordinates.append((i, j))\n    \n    if not coordinates:\n        return []\n    \n    coordinates.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))\n    return coordinates\n\n# Test the function\nprint(get_row([\n  [1,2,3,4,5,6],\n  [1,2,3,4,1,6],\n  [1,2,3,4,5,1]\n], 1))  # == [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]\nprint(get_row([], 1))  # == []\nprint(get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3))  # == [(2, 2)]\n```\n\nThis updated code is more consistent and follows best practices for coding style and documentation.\n\nPlease refine the code based on initial prompt and feedback: The updated code is well-structured and follows best practices for coding style and documentation.

For example, what if the user enters a date string that is not in the correct format, but is still a valid date? The code currently returns `False` in this case, but it might be more user-friendly to return an error message instead.\n\nAdditionally, the code assumes that the input date string is always in the format `mm-dd-yyyy`. If the input date string is in a different format, the code will not work correctly.
